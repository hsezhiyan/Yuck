# Yuck
### Learning to implement an imperative language in the twenty-first century.

#### Imperative languages? What is this, 1996?

#### Why are you using Java for the Frontend? Are you a masochist?

#### Roadmap

1. Specification of the `yuck` language.
2. Turning text into trees.
3. Turning trees into "ycode" programs.
4. Interpreting "ycode" directly.
5. A few linters and static analyzers.
6. Simple peep-hole optimizations.
7. Gradually typing yucky code.
8. Smell-proofing yucky code: contracts and type refinements.
9. Instrumentation and profiling support, or how I stopped worrying about the smell and learned to love yuck.
10. JITing machine code directly from yuck-code: a crash course on contemporary tracing dynamic compilers.
